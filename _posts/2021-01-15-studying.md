# Graph Partitioning

Graph cut: Set of edges with one endpoint in each group
$$
cut(A,B) = \sum_{i \in A, j \in B} w_{ij}
$$
where $w_{ij}$ is the weighted edges between i and j

Graph Cut Criterion:
* Minumin cut 
  * problems: only consider external cluster connections
* Conductance
  * $\phi(A,B) = \frac{cut(A,B)}{min(vol(A), vol(B))}$, where $vol(A)$ is the total weighted degreee of nodes in A
  * Produces more balanced partitions
  * problem: Computing the best cut is NP-hard

Adjacency matrix(A)
Degree Matrix(D) 
Laplacian matrix(L): $L = D - A$

We would like to find the 2nd smallest eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $L$
$$
\lambda_2 = min_{x: x^Tw_1 = 0} \frac{x^TMx}{x^Tx} = min_{\sumx_i=0} \frac{\sum_{(i,j) \in E} (x_i - x_j)^2}{\sum_i x_i^2}
$$

# Spectral Clustering Algorithm
1) Pre-processing
Construct a matrix representation of the graph
2) Decomposition
Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix (only care the 2nd smallest eigenvalues)
Map each point to a lower-dimensional representation based on one or more eigenvectors
3) Grouping
Assign points to two or more clusters, based on the new representation

# Motif-based spectral clustering
motifs cut
$vol_M(S)$ = #(motif end-points	in	S)
$$
\phi(S) = \frac{#(motifs cut)}{vol_M(S)}
$$

Three steps
1) Pre-processing
$W_{i,j}^(M)$= # times edge (i,j) participates in the motif $M$
2) Decomposition (standard sprctral clustering)
set $L^(M) = D^(M) - W^(M)$, get 2nd eigenvalues and eigenvectors
3) Grouping
Sort nodes by their values in $x$: x1, x2, …xn. Let Sr = {x1, …, xr} and compute the motif conductance of each $S_r$
